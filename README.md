WeBuyYourGames.com

Turn those old games you have sitting around into cash today !!!

The purpose of this app is to allow users to login/register, post which items they would like to sell 
to WeBuyYourGames.com and that information to be held in a database.  Hypothetically, the business would be able to review the items the user wants to sell and offer money for the games/items.  If we were to take it one step further, this business would buy games/items for a lower price and sell on marketplaces like ebay, amazon,etc.

This model is based on the Decluttr app which offers money for old items that are taking up space.
