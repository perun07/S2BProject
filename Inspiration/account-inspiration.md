I like the Decluttr account page.  Simple and easy to access your past order 

The app we are creating is based on the Declutter website that is currently online.  

We liked the real world opportunity that there is to resell users old video games and consoles on marketplaces like Amazon.com, Ebay.com, Offerup.com, etc.
